*Version: 0.5.0*

### Work in Progress

This plugin is currently under active development. As such, some features are in the process of being refined, and additional functionalities may be introduced in the future. I am working diligently to enhance the plugin's capabilities and ensure a stable and feature-rich release. Feedback and suggestions are highly welcome.

## Description

The WooCommerce Bsale Integration Plugin is designed to improve the WooCommerce experience by introducing seamless synchronization capabilities and automated invoice generation. The end goal is minimizing manual effort and enhancing operational efficiency. To achieve this, several key features are planned for the plugin, which are detailed below.

### Main Features

- **Stock synchronization**: The plugin has several options to keep the stock levels in sync with Bsale, including manual, scheduled, and real-time stock updates. The real-time updates can be triggered by actions either in the admin area or on the storefront, and can be activated or deactivated according to your needs.

- **Price synchronization**: Planned feature.

- **Invoice generation**: Ability to generate invoices in Bsale when an order changes status to a specific one, which can be configured in the settings page.


## Installation

1. Download the plugin files.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" screen in WordPress.
4. Navigate to the "WooCommerce Bsale" settings page to configure the plugin.

## Configuration

After installation, set the sandbox API key in the main settings page. Once your API key is set, you can enable different triggers for stock updates in the stock settings page. As more features are added, additional settings and settings pages will be included to configure the plugin.
